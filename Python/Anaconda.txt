When installing Anaconda or Miniconda, there might be an error saying "Failed to create menus" happening shortly before the installation progress could be finished. 

Tips are:
1. Remove all Java related variables from environment path.
2. Remove all python, conda, etc, from registry. (Make sure they cannot be found from windows start menu.)
3. Use cmd (open with admin) to run the installer. Before running, enter 'set path = '.
4. Select "All Users" instead of "Just Me" in the first steps of installation.
