Solve the problem of adding new fonts (like "Open Sans Condensed") into Python.

When you add new fonts to your system, you need to delete your fontList.cache file in order for matplotlib to find them.
The fontList.cache is located in %userprofile%\.matplotlib\ in Windows system.
Then make sure the font file is downloaded and saved to the right directory.

import matplotlib
font = {'family' : 'normal',
        'weight' : 'bold',
        'size'   : 22}
matplotlib.rc('font', **font)

Then you can use matplotlib as usual.
