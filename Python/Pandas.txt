How to add a new row to pandas dataframe?

This is not an easy question if you have a datetime index.
One possible solution is:

df.loc["some index"] = "some value"

However, this may introduce one problem. In case "some index" is already in the df, then old value will be overwritten instead of adding a new row.

So two suggestions are provided here:

1. Check whether "some index" is already in df, before doing the insertion.
2. Use distinct integers as index.
